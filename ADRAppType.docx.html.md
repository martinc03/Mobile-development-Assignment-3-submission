Decision Title: Native, Web, or Hybrid App

Date: October 9, 2023

Status: Approved

Context: We are tasked with choosing the approach for developing a university social networking mobile app.

Options:

* Native App
* Hybrid App
* Web App

Decision: We have decided to develop the university social networking app as a Hybrid App.

Rationale: Efficiency: A hybrid app allows us to develop for both iOS and Android platforms using a single codebase, reducing development time effort and maintenance requirements. A hybrid app allows offline capabilities allowing professors and students to access the app features without a stable internet connection. Hybrid apps also allow cross-platform capabilities allowing our users to access the app on a wide range of devices.

Consequences:

* As hybrid apps bridge with native and web apps, development may require more expertise.
* Slower performance than native apps

Follow-Up Actions

* Begin development using a hybrid app framework.
